# Hibernate-ORS-03
Its A Online-Result-System Using Hibernate , BootStrap 4 and JasperReport

## Overview

ORS-Hibernate is a Java web application (or desktop? clarify) project that uses Hibernate as the ORM framework, MySQL as the database, and incorporates Jasper Reports for reporting. The goal is to build an Online Reservation System (ORS) / whatever ORS stands for in your project, handling reservations, user data, etc., with robust data persistence and reporting capabilities.

## Features

- CRUD operations for entities (e.g. Users, Reservations, etc.)
- Data persistence with Hibernate
- MySQL relational database backend
- Report generation with Jasper Reports
- Possibly (if applicable): search, filtering, exportable reports (PDF / Excel), etc.

## Tools & Technologies

| Tool / Framework | Purpose |
|------------------|---------|
| **Hibernate** | Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), to map Java objects to database tables |
| **MySQL** | Relational database to store persisted data |
| **Jasper Reports** | For generating reports (PDF/HTML/others) based on data in DB |
| **Eclipse IDE** | For development environment and project management |
| **Java** (version - specify version) | Programming language |
| Other libraries (specify) | E.g. if you use Servlets / JSP / Spring / etc. |

## Project Structure

Here’s a brief on how your project is organized (adjust based on actual files):


## Setup / Installation

Here are steps to get the project running locally:

1. **Prerequisites**

   - Install Java (version X)  
   - Install MySQL  
   - Install JasperReports library / or include in your project dependencies  
   - Eclipse IDE

2. **Database Setup**

   - Create a database, e.g. `ors_db`  
   - Execute the SQL schema script (if provided) to create tables.  
   - Note down username/password, DB URL.

3. **Configure Hibernate**

   - Edit `hibernate.cfg.xml` (or whatever config file) to set DB connection properties, dialect, etc.  
   - Ensure mappings for your entities are correct.

4. **Running the application**

   - Import the project into Eclipse.  
   - Add necessary external libraries (Hibernate, MySQL connector, JasperReports etc.). If using Maven/Gradle, check the `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`.  
   - Compile and run.

5. **Generating Reports**

   - Jasper report templates are located in `reports/` (or wherever).  
   - Use the report generator classes / utility to fill the report with data.  
   - Reports can be exported to PDF/HTML/Other formats as configured.

## Configuration

- **Database Properties**: host, port, username, password — set in `hibernate.cfg.xml`  
- **Hibernate Dialect**: MySQL (specify version)  
- **Jasper Reports Paths**: path to `.jrxml` or `.jasper` files  
- **Output Formats / Paths**: where the generated reports will be stored / viewed

## Usage

- How to perform basic operations (e.g. login, reservation, report viewing)  
- Example commands or UI steps (if there’s a front end)  
- How to generate a report (which class/method to call, or which UI option)

## Known Issues / Limitations

- (If there are any)  
- E.g. no authentication, limited error handling, performance constraints, etc.

## Future Enhancements

- Add user authentication & authorization  
- Support more report formats or user-customizable reports  
- Use frameworks like Spring Boot for easier setup  
- Deploy on server (Tomcat / WildFly etc.)
